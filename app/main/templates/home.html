                            We invite both for-profit and nonprofit ventures to apply. We also welcome you to meet with Halloran Lab staff to strategize how best to conduct the research and determine 
                            key assumptions. Halloran Lab will try to match grantees with Colby alumni and industry experts to assist with the research.
